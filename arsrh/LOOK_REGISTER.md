# LOOK_REGISTER — ARS Look Arc

Places worth pointing the instrument next. **This is not a findings doc. Nothing cites it as support.**

**Register rules in force** (from the session spec §R): entries do not accumulate, sum, or reinforce;
N entries pointing one way is N entries. POST is permanent and is never edited to PRE. No σ/z/p on
entries from regions where no calibrator bracket exists. Demotion and retirement are results of the same
grade as addition.

### R-001 — Phase-2 σ-column decline between blocks is effect-size, not null variance
- **Seen:** t=0 row, block-1 → block-2: z falls 2.0414 → 1.2604. Decomposed: the ζ−control **gap** falls
  0.018634 → 0.008732 (ratio 0.469); the control **sd** falls 0.009128 → 0.006928 (ratio 0.759). In logs,
  Δln z = −0.482 = **−0.758 (effect)** + **+0.276 (variance)**. The variance change is a *headwind*: had the
  gap held, the new sd would have given z = **2.69**, not 1.26. So 100%+ of the σ decline is effect-size.
- **Where:** `phase2_residual_measured.json` row t=0 (γ=2516.571); `phase2_thetacert_freshblock.json`
  `sigma_shape` row t=0 (γ=33923.100). Arithmetic only — no run.
- **Pre-registered or post-hoc:** **POST**
- **NOT claimed:** (a) not that the gap shrank *significantly* — Δgap = 0.009902 against a combined
  sd of 0.011459 is **0.86σ**, i.e. the two blocks' gaps are statistically compatible; (b) not that this
  corroborates P1's crossover — direction agrees, magnitude cannot discriminate; (c) not a second witness:
  block-2's t=0 row is the *same measurement family* as P1's own W=2000 γ=33923 row (P1 dev = +0.008482 vs
  P2 gap = +0.008732 — same zeros, two nulls); (d) **the variance leg is not slot-verified** — block-1 has
  W_int=2000 and block-2 is a 2000-zero block whose interior width is unrecoverable
  (`LOOK_ARC_PROVENANCE.md` #13/#14), so part of the sd ratio may be a window-size artifact, not height.
- **What would make it a lead:** re-running block-2's control at *explicitly* W_int=2000 with the block-1
  construction. If the gap ratio survives at matched W, the height-decline is clean.
- **Cost to check:** one flow-control block (~minutes) *after* the Phase-2 control script is reconstructed.
- **Status:** OPEN

### R-002 — The finite-window ⟨r̃⟩ jitter floor does not scale as W^(−1/2)
- **Seen:** Phase-1 null sd at W = 2000 / 5000 / 10000 = 0.005442 / 0.003800 / 0.003030. Implied
  c = sd·√W = 0.243 / 0.269 / 0.303 — monotonically increasing. Log-log fit: **sd ≈ 0.0868·W^(−0.365)**.
- **Where:** `phase1_zeta_crossover_measured.json` `by_W[*].null_sd`.
- **Pre-registered or post-hoc:** **POST**
- **NOT claimed:** not established as a real anomalous exponent. Each sd is estimated from n_real =
  80/60/40 draws (relative error ~8–11%), so three points with a monotone trend is suggestive, not decided.
  Two mundane explanations are untested: edge effects in the Dumitriu–Edelman central-window extraction
  growing with W, and correlation between r̃ values reducing the effective sample.
- **What would make it a lead:** a dedicated null-only sweep — W ∈ {1000 … 40000}, n_real ≥ 400 each, fit
  the exponent with a confidence interval. This is the **W-sweep** item, correctly re-slotted: it is a
  *null-calibration* measurement, not a ζ measurement.
- **Cost to check:** cheap; pure synthetic, no ζ data. Hours at most.
- **Status:** OPEN — and it already has a consequence: every "×floor" number in Phase 2 is inflated
  (see `LOOK_ARC_PROVENANCE.md` §B/#12).

### R-003 — Phase 2's θ-certification is inert for any long-range statistic
- **Seen:** the θ-cert measured `dr_mean` — a **Δ⟨r̃⟩** — and got 0.000000 at every t. But P1 established
  that r̃ is *invariant* to smooth density, and the θ-truncation is a smooth-density perturbation. So the
  cert could not have fired **by construction**, exactly like P1's original unfold falsifier.
- **Where:** `phase2_thetacert_freshblock.json` `theta_cert[*].dr_mean`.
- **Pre-registered or post-hoc:** **POST**
- **NOT claimed:** not that θ-truncation *is* a problem — only that the existing certificate carries no
  information about it. Σ², Δ₃ and F(α) all consume the smooth density directly and are *not* protected by
  this cert. Phase 3 already relies on the θ-exact unfold (`rvm_N`, leading order + 7/8) with no cert of
  its own.
- **What would make it a lead:** re-run the θ-cert on a statistic that *can* see it (Σ² or F(α)), comparing
  `rvm_N` against `rvm_N + 1/(48πt)`. Prediction is that it stays inert (the correction is ~5×10⁻⁴ levels
  at γ=14), but then it would be **demonstrably** inert rather than structurally inert.
- **Cost to check:** minutes. **Folded into Task B.**
- **Status:** OPEN

### R-004 — Three-height matched-density ⟨r̃⟩ excess, monotone but heterogeneous
- **Seen:** ζ minus matched-density GUE null: γ=1420.4 → +0.017316 (+2.45σ); γ=33923.1 → +0.008732
  (+1.26σ); γ=1131971.6 → −0.000966 (−0.17σ). Monotone decline, the shape P1's crossover asserts.
- **Where:** `phase1_density_check_measured.json` rows 1 and 2; middle point from
  `phase2_thetacert_freshblock.json` t=0.
- **Pre-registered or post-hoc:** **POST**
- **NOT claimed:** **not a three-point series.** The two outer points are W=2000, n_real=30, unflowed
  matched-density nulls from one script; the middle point is a t=0 row of a *flow* control with B=12 and an
  unverifiable interior width. Different construction, different realization count, possibly different W.
  It is two points plus a differently-built third. No slope is fitted here and none should be.
- **What would make it a lead:** measure the middle height with `phase1_density_check.py` itself — same
  script, same W, same n_real. That converts it into an actual three-point series.
- **Cost to check:** one script invocation with a third `starts` entry. Very cheap. **Not run this session
  — it has no seal.**
- **Status:** OPEN

### R-005 — CP1 parity-count labels are inverted relative to the file's own convention
- **Seen:** `maass_analysis.py:45` fixes sym0 = EVEN and `names={0:"even",1:"odd"}` (line 179) follows it,
  but lines 96–97 compute `even_count = (sym==1).sum()` = 334, `odd_count = (sym==0).sum()` = 266.
- **Where:** `sessionK/maass_analysis.py:96-97` vs `:45`, `:179`.
- **Pre-registered or post-hoc:** **POST**
- **NOT claimed:** **not a result error.** The sectors split on the raw symmetry field, so sector "even"
  correctly carries n=266 and ⟨r̃⟩=0.3992, matching Phase 4's parity=0. Only the completeness-block labels
  are swapped. Nothing downstream consumed them.
- **What would make it a lead:** nothing — it is a fix, not a lead. Listed because it sits inside the file
  CP1 rests on and is the program's dominant error mode.
- **Cost to check:** done.
- **Status:** OPEN (pending a one-line fix; will be RETIRED on fix)
